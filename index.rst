The Welcome post
-----------------

Each time you visit the MTH HELP Piazza forum, begin by clicking on the Welcome post, 
which is always "pinned" at the top of the list of posts
on the left side of the screen. 

When the Help Center is open, it will look something like what's shown below,
with information about the staff who are currently on duty,
and links to the Zoom meetings in which they will help you:

Next, you should make a post on the forum, describing the question you have.
By making this post you effectively claim your place in line. Visitors are served
on a first-come first-served basis.

Zoom
-----

Zoom meetings are the primary means of communicating with the Help Center staff.

If you have not used Zoom before, go to `<https://buffalo.zoom.us>`__ and configure your account,
and download the app.
